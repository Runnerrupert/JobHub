## Installation

Before getting started you will want to make sure you install the following: 

* Node.js
* MongoDB

Once the repository files are on your local machine, you will want to navigate to the project directory. 
When you're in the project, navigate to the server by running 'cd server' in the terminal, and then install the dependencies by running 'npm install'. 
Now the same thing, but this time use 'cd client' and follow it with 'npm install' as well.
Locate the .env file and make sure you have the variable for 'JWT_Secret_Key'
Then you can navigate back to the server, and enter the command 'npm start'. This should start the server, and you should see a message stating that the
database has been connected, and that the server is running. 
Then you'll want to navigate back to the client and run npm run dev, and a link to http://localhost:3000/ should appear.
